        "If time allows, wrap the dough and let refrigerate for **20-30 minutes**.  Roll into small balls until round and smooth.  Drop into the cinnamon-sugar mixture and coat well. Using a spoon, coat for a second time, ensuring the cookie balls are completely covered.  *To make flatter snickerdoodles, press down in the center of the ball before placing in the oven. This helps to keep them from puffing up in the middle.*",
        "Place on a parchment paper-lined baking sheet. Bake for **9-11 minutes**.  Let cool for several minutes on baking sheet before removing from the pan. "
