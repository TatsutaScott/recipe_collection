In a small bowl, whisk eggs and vanilla until combined, then add the egg mixture to the batter and whisk until incorporated. Scrape down the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula, cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 12 or up to 24 hours.",

Remove the waffle batter from the refrigerator (it will be foamy and doubled in size) and whisk to recombine (the batter will deflate). Spray the waffle iron with non-stick cooking spray and cook according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions. Serve the waffles hot off the iron."
